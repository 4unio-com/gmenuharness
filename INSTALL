Build dependencies
------------------

See debian/control for the list of packages required to build and test the code.


Building the code
-----------------

The simplest case is:

    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake ..
    $ make

By default, the code is built in release mode. To build a debug version, use

    $ mkdir builddebug
    $ cd builddebug
    $ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=debug ..
    $ make
